Data Preprocessing With Numpy 
Hi, I used csv file and Numpy library to preprocess the data. I followed Practical Example from 365datascience.com Course.
First we did Setting Up: Importhing the Data Set, Chechking dor Incomplete Data, Splitting the Dataset.
Second we did Manipulation of Text Data: Issue Date, Loan Status and Term, Grade and Sub Grade, Verification Status & URL, State Adress, Converting Strings.
Then we did Manipulation of Numeric Data: Currency Change - The Exchange Rate and Currency Exchange - from USD to EUR.
In the end, we Completed the final Dataset.
